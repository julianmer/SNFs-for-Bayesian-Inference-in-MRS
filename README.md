# Physics-Informed Sylvester Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Inference in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

[Physics-Informed Sylvester Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Inference in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy]()

## Abstract

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique to measure the metabolic composition of tissues, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders, tumor detection, and other metabolic dysfunctions. However, accurate metabolite quantification is hindered by challenges such as spectral overlap, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various artifacts. Traditional methods like linear-combination modeling are susceptible to ambiguities and commonly only provide a theoretical lower bound on estimation accuracy in the form of the CramÂ´er-Rao bound. This work introduces a Bayesian inference framework using Sylvester normalizing flows (SNFs) to approximate posterior distributions over metabolite concentrations, enhancing quantification reliability. A physics-based decoder incorporates prior knowledge of MRS signal formation, ensuring realistic distribution representations. We validate the method on simulated 7T proton MRS data, demonstrating accurate metabolite quantification, well-calibrated uncertainties, and insights into parameter correlations and multi-modal distributions.
